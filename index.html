		<h1> The 1996 Atlanta Braves </h1>
		<IMG src="braves2.jpg" height=230 width=290>
<p> The 1996 Atlanta Braves, despite their lack of a World Series title, will forever be cemented among the greatest teams in the history of Atlanta sports. Known 
for the incredible talent of their roster and the ability to come back from seemingly any deficit, the legacy of the 
’96 Braves still lives on over two decades later. </p>
<p> The Braves’ foundation revolved around a trio of all-star caliber pitchers and Atlanta sports legends, <span STYLE="font-style: italic"> Greg Maddux, 
Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz. </span> These three pitchers accounted for an astounding 54 wins, with <span STYLE="font-style: italic"> John Smoltz </span> leading the way 
with 24 wins compared to only 8 losses. While the team’s strong pitching staff was the base of their foundation, they also 
had a strong offensive core. 24 year old <span STYLE="font-style: italic"> Chipper Jones,</span> now an Atlanta legend, finished with a team-best batting average of 
.309, also adding 30 home runs and a whopping 110 RBI’s. Not far behind Chipper, Centerfielder <span STYLE="font-style: italic"> Marquis Grissom </span> batted .308 
while hitting 23 home runs. These players, along with other key contributors such as Catcher <span STYLE="font-style: italic"> Javy Lopez </span> and First Baseman <span STYLE="font-style: italic"> Fred McGriff </span>, 
created a dangerous offense that was capable of scoring runs very quickly. <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ATL/1996.shtml">Check out their stats here.</a> </p>

<p> The braves finished first in the NL East and proceeded to win the first round of the playoffs with ease, sweeping the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-0. 
The outlook did not look as optimistic however, when the team found themselves down 3-1to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 7-game National League Championship Series. 
Things took a turn in Game 5, where the Braves had 22 hits in a 14-0 rout of the Cardinals to bring the series to 3-2. The Braves would go on to win the next 2 games 
to advance to the World Series. </p>
<p> The Braves started off hot against the Yankees in the World Series, winning the first 2 games with relative ease. However, they would go on to lose the next 3 games 
in Atlanta, and despite the strong pitching effort by John Maddux in Game 6, the Braves lost the World Series to the Yankees in New York. <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1996_WS.shtml">A recap of the series can be found here.</a>   Despite being on the wrong end 
of one of the great championship comebacks in professional sports history, the 1996 Braves will forever be remembered as one of Atlanta’s greatest teams. </p>
